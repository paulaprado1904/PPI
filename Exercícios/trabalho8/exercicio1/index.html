      <h2>Perfil</h2>
      <p>Little is known about Melinda's early history, other than she moved away from LA to escape the painful memories
        of her past. It is later revealed that Mel has trouble conceiving and experienced a stillbirth, and this
        negatively affected her marriage with Mark during the later years. After their fifth failed attempt at
        pregnancy, Mel and Mark disagreed on continuing IVF treatment, with Mark wanting to stop; Mel was reluctant to
        stop the treatment, however, wanting to have a child of her own with Mark.</p>
      <p>On the night of Mark's death, the two were arguing about whether to continue treatment or not. Mel told Mark
        that she thought they should take a break, and when Mark took his eyes off the road, the two are hit by a truck
        and Mark was fatally wounded and later died in hospital.</p>
