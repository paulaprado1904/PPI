                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                  industry's
                  standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
                  make
                  a
                  type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                  remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                  containing
                  Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
                  versions
                  of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
                  Latin
                  literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                  Hampden-Sydney
                  College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
                  and
                  going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
                  comes
                  from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
                  Cicero,
                  written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
                  first
                  line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
